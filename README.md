## Introduction  

This project analyzes a dataset of Bitcoin prices from 2013 to 2017, including daily opening, closing, highest, and lowest values. Using R programming, the dataset was cleaned, processed, and visualized to uncover historical trends and compute statistical measures. Key packages like `tidyverse`, `janitor`, and `lubridate` were utilized for efficient data manipulation and analysis.

---

## Tasks  

### 1. Data Loading and Cleaning  
- **Data Import**: The dataset was loaded using `read_csv()` from the `tidyverse` package.  
- **Cleaning**: Variable names were cleaned using `clean_names()` from the `janitor` package.  
- **Date Conversion**: The `dmy()` function from the `lubridate` package converted date values into a standard format.  
- **Year Extraction**: A new column, `year`, was added to store the year for each date.

```R
bitcoin <- read_csv("Bitcoin.csv")
bitcoin <- clean_names(bitcoin)
bitcoin$date <- dmy(bitcoin$date)
bitcoin$year <- year(bitcoin$date)
```

---

### 2. Statistical Calculations  
Summary statistics for the `close` variable (daily closing prices):  
- **Mean**: `695.56`  
- **Median**: `447.53`  
- **Standard Deviation**: `800.56`  
- **Minimum**: `68.43`  
- **Maximum**: `4892.01`  

```R
mean_close <- mean(bitcoin$close)
median_close <- median(bitcoin$close)
sd_close <- sd(bitcoin$close)
min_close <- min(bitcoin$close)
max_close <- max(bitcoin$close)
summary_close <- summary(bitcoin$close)
```

---

### 3. Data Subsetting  

#### a. Annual Averages  
Grouped by year, the average closing price of Bitcoin was calculated and stored in a new data frame, `bitcoin_year`.  
```R
bitcoin_year <- bitcoin %>% group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(avg_rating = mean(close, na.rm = TRUE))
```

#### b. Daily Closes  
A new data frame, `bitcoin_date`, grouped by date, duplicated the `close` variable for visualization purposes.  
```R
bitcoin_date <- bitcoin %>% group_by(date) %>%
  mutate(close = close)
```

---

### 4. Data Visualizations  

#### a. Line Plot  
**Title**: "Line Plot of Years vs. Prices of Bitcoin"  
- **X-axis**: Years  
- **Y-axis**: Average closing prices  
- **Purpose**: Visualizes yearly average prices.

#### b. Scatter Plot  
**Title**: "Scatter Plot of Pages vs. Ratings"  
- **X-axis**: Date  
- **Y-axis**: Daily closing prices  
- **Purpose**: Visualizes daily closing prices with color-coded points.

# Module 3 R Practice

## Introduction
This R script performs comprehensive analysis and statistical testing on Bitcoin data. It includes data cleaning, summary statistics calculation, graphical representation of statistics, and hypothesis testing using one-sample and two-sample t-tests.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Data Loading and Cleaning
- **Reading CSV File:**
  ```R
  bit_df <- read_csv("BitCoin.csv")
  ```
  The dataset contains six columns: `id`, `date`, `open`, `high`, `low`, and `close`. The `date` column is converted from character to date format using the `dmy()` function.

- **Data Preparation:**
  - Converted `date` column to a date format.
  - Extracted `year` and `month` from the `date` column using `lubridate`.

---

### 2. Statistical Calculations
- Calculated summary statistics (`min`, `max`, `mean`, `median`, `sd`) for the columns `open`, `close`, `high`, and `low`.

#### Example Summary Statistics Table (for `open` column):
| min_open | max_open | mean_open | median_open | sd_open |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| 68.5     | 4901.42  | 693.4974  | 446.89      | 797.3651 |

- Combined statistics for all columns into a summary table:
  | min_open | max_open | mean_open | median_open | sd_open | category |
  |----------|----------|-----------|-------------|---------|----------|
  | 74.6     | 4975.04  | 712.7766  | 452.48      | 825.6228| High     |
  | 65.5     | 4679.53  | 674.3655  | 440.5       | 768.1094| Low      |
  | 68.5     | 4901.42  | 693.4974  | 447.89      | 797.3651| Open     |
  | 68.43    | 4892.01  | 695.5634  | 447.53      | 800.5576| Close    |

---

### 3. Data Visualizations
- Created bar plots to visualize:
  - Median and Standard Deviation (Figure 1)
  - Minimum, Maximum, and Mean (Figure 2)

- Example code snippet for bar plots:

### 4. Hypothesis Testing
- Conducted **One-Sample T-Tests**:
  - `open`: Mean is greater than 500 (p-value < 0.05)
  - `close`: No significant difference from 700 (p-value > 0.05)
  - `high`: Mean significantly differs from 800 (p-value < 0.05)
  - `low`: Mean significantly differs from 1000 (p-value < 0.05)

- Conducted **Two-Sample T-Tests**:
  - Paired T-Test (Open vs Close): No significant difference (p-value > 0.05).
  - Independent T-Test (High vs Low): No significant difference (p-value > 0.05).

#### Example T-Test Results:
```R
t_test_open <- t.test(bit_df$open, mu = 500, conf.level = 0.95)
print(t_test_open)
```
**Result:**
- t = 9.7341
- p-value = 1
- Confidence Interval: (-Inf, 726.2132)

## Tasks

### 1. Data Loading and Cleaning
1. **Reading the CSV File**
   - The dataset contains six columns: `id`, `date`, `open`, `high`, `low`, and `close`.
   - Column types were verified and formatted as needed.

2. **Cleaning the Dataset**
   - Converted the `date` column to a proper date format using `lubridate::dmy()`.
   - Extracted `year` and `month` from the `date` column for temporal analysis.

### 2. Statistical Analysis
**Summary Statistics for Key Columns:**
- Calculated minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation for `open`, `close`, `high`, and `low` columns.
- Combined results into a single summary table with the following metrics:
  
  | Category | Min   | Max    | Mean   | Median | Std. Dev |
  |----------|-------|--------|--------|--------|----------|
  | High     | 74.6  | 4975.0 | 713.0  | 452.0  | 826.0    |
  | Low      | 65.5  | 4679.0 | 674.0  | 440.0  | 768.0    |
  | Open     | 68.5  | 4901.4 | 693.5  | 446.9  | 797.4    |
  | Close    | 68.4  | 4892.0 | 696.0  | 448.0  | 801.0    |

### 3. Correlation Analysis & Visualization
- **Correlation Matrix:**
  - Strong linear relationships were observed among the `open`, `close`, `high`, and `low` columns (correlation values close to 1).
  - `Month` exhibited weak correlations with price-related columns (values close to 0).

- **Correlation Plot:**
  - Visualized using `ggcorrplot`, which clearly represented these relationships with labeled circular charts.

- **Linear Regression Model:**
  - Dependent Variable: `close`
  - Independent Variable: `open`

- **Model Results:**
  - Equation: `close = 0.780690 + 1.001853 * open`
  - R-squared: `0.9957` (indicating a very strong model fit).
  - Residual Standard Error: `52.39`
  - Coefficients:
    - `open`: Significant (p < 2e-16) with a coefficient of `1.001853`.
    - Intercept: Not statistically significant (p = 0.652).
